Knex.js
a "batteries included" SQL query builder for Postgres
designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use. It features both traditional node style callbacks
as well as a promise interface for cleaner async flow control, a stream interface, 
full-featured query and schema builders, transaction support (with savepoints), 
connection pooling and standardized responses between different query clients and dialects.
